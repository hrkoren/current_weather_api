## Known Issues

1. Cannot get city history list to function as buttons.
2. Cannot pull UV Index - code is there but commented out. Causes 5-day fetch to stop when not commented out.
3. Could not get the boxes arranged the way I wanted, so the layout of the page is not as intended.
4. When a new city is searched, the 5-day is not clearing and each city's just keeps iterating.
